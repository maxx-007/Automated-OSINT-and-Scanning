# Automated OSINT-and Scanning
 This repository contains automated scripts for conducting open-source intelligence (OSINT) gathering and network scanning using Recon-ng and RustScan. The scripts streamline the process of information gathering and vulnerability assessment, making it easier for security professionals and ethical hackers to evaluate target systems efficiently.
# Features:

   Automated Recon-ng Script:
        Perform comprehensive OSINT tasks using the Recon-ng framework.
        Gather data from multiple sources and APIs to build a detailed profile of the target.
        Store and manage collected data for easy access and analysis.

   Automated RustScan Script:
        Quickly identify open ports on target systems with high-speed scanning capabilities.
        Output results in a clear, readable format for further analysis.
        Integrate with additional scanning tools for more extensive network assessments.

# Purpose:

This project aims to enhance the efficiency of reconnaissance and scanning tasks during penetration testing and security assessments. By automating these processes, users can save time and focus on analyzing results and planning further actions.
Prerequisites:

    Python 3.x
    Required libraries (check requirements.txt)

# Usage:

    Clone the repository and execute the scripts as needed to conduct OSINT and scanning tasks on your designated targets.

# Disclaimer:

# These tools are intended for educational purposes and should only be used in authorized environments with explicit permission from network owners. Unauthorized use is illegal and unethical.
